# SHPP-Node.js-course
I start (one more) course, now I'm trying to learn Node.js

Why? Because it's more popular in my country (Ukraine)
And given that I already know Django (python), it won't take long (or shouldn't at least).

I'll update this file according to the current stage I am in.

## 1. Intro to JS

... So, 1st "stage" of the course is "intro to JS", what it means:
### 1.1 Data types & operators. Objects and functions

  2. Time to practice:
  Create a "Product" constructor function to create objects. 
  <details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
  Create following properties and methods:
    
  - property ID (str)
  
  - property name (str)
  
  - proterty description (str)
  
  - property price (double)
  
  - property brand (str)
  
  - property sizes (array of ['XS', 'S', 'M', 'L', 'XL', 'XXL'])
  - property activeSize
  - property quantity
  - property date
  - property reviews = array of {id, author, date, comment, rating = array of {key(str), value(int)}}
  - property images
  - method getProperty()
  - method setProperty()
  
  Create functions:
  - search (searches product in products array by name/description)
  - sort (sorts products according by second parameter) (it should support sorting by id/name/price)

### 1.2 QUIZ (1)
<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
  The meaning of this part is to "confirm" the knowledge. I won't publish all the questions I had to answer, only several of them, so you can "guess" what kind of questions there were:
  
  - what is "var"?
  
  - what the difference between "const" and "let" ?
  
  - what is "__proto__" ? 
  
  - what of "string, char, boolean, float, double, number, object, array, function, int" JS has?
